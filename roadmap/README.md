# EC's roadmap
This document outlines the Enterprise Contract's roadmap, articulated through its mission, vision, and goals. 

## EC's mission
Be the standard product used to verify supply chain artifacts, and enforce policies about how they were built and tested, in a manageable, scalable, and declarative way.

### Defining features
* Lazy evaluation
* Not an admissions controller
* Used as a gating mechanism
* Used in CI
* Early detection
* Used to verify any config, notably attestations, VSAs (in the future).


## EC's vision
### From a userâ€™s perspective:
* To provide a mechanism for verifying an artifact was built by a system that meets a certain standard.
* Be able to apply multiple policies to an artifact.
* To provide a pluggable way to apply policies to an artifact.

### From an engineers perspective
* An engineer is able to define, craft and apply policies for an artifact and verify a standard is met before release time.
* An engineer is able to verify configs that will be used to build a product before the config is put to use.

## Goals
TBD
